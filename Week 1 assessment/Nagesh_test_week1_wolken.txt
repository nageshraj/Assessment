What is an Object?
	An object is an instance of a class. They can be created in blocks, methods and constructors.
	Syntax: ClassName reference =  new ClassName;

What is a Class?
	Class is a blueprint or template with states and behaviour from which multiple objects can be created.
	Syntax: class ClassName{
		}

What is variables? why we use variables?
	Variables are containers for holding data. Variables can be of different types to hold different types of data.

What are instance variables?
	Variables declared within the class but outside the function. 

What is a static variable?
	Variables declared using the 'static' keyword are called static variables. These variables are accessed using the 
	ClassName rather the Reference variable as in the case of normal variables.
	Syntax: static dataType variable-name;


What is the difference between class variable and instance variable?
	Class variables are also known as static variables. 
	The main differences are:
	* class variables are accessed through className whereas instance variables are accessed through refernce/Object.
	* class variables are declared using static keyword whereas instance variables are not.


How will you create an object? with example?
	An object can be created by creating a reference to the class. This is done using the new keyword:
		class Shoe{
			String name;
			String color;

			public static void main(String a[]){
				Shoe nike = new Shoe();
			}
		}

		
	

What is a method?
	Methods are a set of instructions which perform a specific task. They are executed only when they are called.
	Methods increase code reusablity.
	Syntax: returnType MethodName(Parameter list){
		// some task		
	}

what is method overloading?  
	Methods having the same names but different signatures(number of parameters, data type of parameters, 
	order of parameters) can be overloaded. Overloading refers to making the same function behave differently based
	on the user's requirement.
	

Practical
method overloading
	class Area{
		void area(){
			System.out.println("Area cannot be calculated");
		}
		int area(int a){
			return a*a;
		}
		
		int area(int a, int b){
			return a*b;
		}
		
		public static void main(String a[]){
			Area obj = new Area();
			System.out.println(obj.area(5));
			System.out.println(obj.area(5,10));
			obj.area();
		
		}
	}
print month of year
	class Month{
	public static void main(String a[]){
		int mon=4;
		switch(mon){
			case 1: System.out.println("January");
					break;
			case 2: System.out.println("February");
					break;
			case 3: System.out.println("March");
					break;
			case 4: System.out.println("April");
					break;
			case 5: System.out.println("May");
					break;
			case 6: System.out.println("June");
					break;
			case 7: System.out.println("July");
					break;
			case 8: System.out.println("August");
					break;
			case 9: System.out.println("September");
					break;
			case 10: System.out.println("October");
					break;
			case 11: System.out.println("November");
					break;
			case 12: System.out.println("December");
					break;
			default: System.out.println("Enter valid month");
		}
	}

factorial 

class Factorial{  
	public static void main(String a[]){  
  		int fact=1;  
  		int num=5;   
  		for(int i=1;i<=number;i++){    
      			fact=fact*i;    
  		}    
  	System.out.println("Factorial is: "+fact);    
 	}  
}
